## Remembering Tony Alfrey

#### January 16, 1951 â€” July 15, 2015 

Friend, Husband, Father, Quantum Physicist, Scientist, Sailor, Exacting Engineer and Builder, Musician and Musicophile, Teacher, Cook, Political Observer and Passionate Commentator, Arbiter of Style, Martini Connoisseur, Insister on Quality in everything.

Inspiring and exasperating, misanthropic and philanthropic, he was a no-bullshit-bring-me-certainty kind of guy, with an awesome breadth of knowledge and capabilities. This page and these words cannot begin to paint a full portrait of this complicated man who was such a presence in our lives.

We will always remember him, each in our own way.
